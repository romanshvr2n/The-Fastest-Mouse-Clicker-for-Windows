# Biult-in Update Serivce

The program has built-in updater service under construction that may perform additional scientific tasks when your CPU is idle with very tiny CPU and Internet usage. See source code of the installer. The application uninstalls clearly and is NOT a virus or malware.

## How to turn it off and on

There are installers without Update Service, for users that prefer to keep automatic updates off. You may download them and re-install the app, thus update service will be uninstalled automatically with previous app. Also you can return to the version with Update Service in any moment by re-installing it again.
